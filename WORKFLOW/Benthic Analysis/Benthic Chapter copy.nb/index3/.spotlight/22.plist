	<string>1st pass of literature {Petchey:2007iw} 3. There was no evidence of ecological redundancy over the 20 years. In fact, changes in functional diversity were almost exactly proportional to changes in species richness. &lt;-Evidence that functional diversity might just be reflecting taxonomic composition {Larsen:2005kr} We studied pollination by bees in a mosaic of agricultural and natural habitats in California and dung burial by dung beetles on recently created islands in Venezuela. We found that large-bodied bee and beetle species tended to be both most extinction-prone and most functionally efficient, contributing to rapid functional loss. Simulations confirmed that extinction order led to greater disruption of function than predicted by random species loss. Individual species may have large influences on Functional diversity  {Loreau:2001be} selection effect is zero on average and varies from negative to positive in different localities, depending on whether species with lower- or higher-than-average biomass dominate communities.  -&gt; skew of abundance distribution affects relationship between FD and species richness / diversity?

In contrast, the complementarity effect is positive overall, supporting the hypothesis that plant diversity influences primary production in European grasslands through niche differentiation or facilitation. -&gt; {Pavoine:2013fo} Conclusions: From both our simulations and analysis of plant community diversity, PD was a poor surrogate for FD. In Mekhada, PD was also less corre- lated with environmental variables than FD. Species richness was found to be a better surrogate for FD than PD in identifying the ecological processes that dis- tribute species along the salinity gradient. DISCUSSION {Hooper:2002ur}  However, a direct correlation between species richness and functional diversity may not always hold at low diversity ends of a gradient. For example, morphological or behavioural plasticity could lead to a breadth of functional attributes with relatively few species (Fig. 17.3(c)). Such a relation- ship does not necessarily solve the experimental problems addressed above, however, because it just raises the important (and largely unanswered) question of how important genetic diversity within species is in affecting ecosystem processes.  </string>
