\f0\fs24 \cf0 I will attempt to muster up all the lyrical power that might remain dormant in this academically trained mind, dust off as many evocative verbs, adjective and idioms and similes to attempt to vivify my argument but I apologise in advance if I fail to deliver. But in this I hope may lie some leneancy too. As you may ask me too what are your credentials for not only making political commentary but also attempting to take on the man of the minute, the new new revolutionary, our new hollow idol in sequens? Well it's all because of a man of course (sorry I wouldn't say attractive, Russell sorry you're just not my type)\
\
While the interview was difficult to swallow, Russell Brand's NewStateman's piece was indeed a masterpiece. Oozing sarcasm and gritty emotion but importantly built robustly from much factual accuracy and inspired insight, a veritable fortress of an argument to most and appladably executed. But is it impenetrable? I think there are cracks...small holes built by circular arguments and historical myopia, \
As much as he laments us (us powerless a bit less than the powerful) and laments our disgusting nature he knows he is one of us and so unfortunately he suffers our same shortcomings.\
\
So there it is, the fortress of mordor, towering over us, the flaming eye scanning mercilessly across the horizon and they want my ring...my one precious...the root of all evil\
It is hard to decide where the blame all lies...with us ofcourse too but corporations and governments are just incurably evil, forget about them, but we are just swept away by our own greed \
\
'They' are all clearly evil and he depicts a great caricature which strikes accord \
He weaves power and powerlessness and at the same time blame in and out on us although who 'we' are exactly I'm not sure. The impoverished \
\
He identifies some important connections\
He has thought of the easy critisims and in fact this is refreshing and makes the read engaging.\
\
He is on to something with the lack of religion\
\
Tesco and the large energy companies are huge because some dark force from the top of mordor is slowly feeding them from our promethean splines. We voluntarily give them our money...we don't need gas. The very fact that we can even be discussing it as a right and necessity shows how far we have come in redifining what it means to be poor. Indeed it exactly the fact they we are doing so well that we have hit the environmental wall and are realising there is now free lunch and this is globally! While the distressing picture painted by the rubbish mountain, it completely glosses over any benefits capitalism may have had in these countries. Many countries in fact, it their lack of strong government structure, access to international markets trade and participation in international organisations that impoverishes them. So it is not the huge capitalism here but the lack of capitalism there. In fact the country I come from Greece is an interesting point in case. Russell you should check out, rioting is a national pass time, you get to get up and close to the police who are sufficiently unprofessionally to bring rage out of grandads, making escalation into anarchic violence an orgasmic release of righteousness and self delusion. Indeed I found it quite comical when taken to a squat in Bristol on a date (that was an interesting one!) I was greeted with enthusiasm and admiration for our countries anarchists who are apparently internationally renowned. It made my stomach turn. Little did the know that the vacuum of weak government, closure to markets and a massive public sector. The climate of hate and mistrusts benetrates to all levels of society making social cooperation very difficult...if anyone who has ever tried to deal with greek bureaucracy. Brand may lament the destituness / disgustingness of living in Britain /  LA but he has never lived in a country that feels like you're continuously banging your head against a wall.  And now there is less government and we have less as people (maybe enough according to Brand? we obviously have too much but I am not sure were his excess line is drawn) so moral levels are low,  police levels are low and low and behold the extremists come out of the woodworks and the nation gushes. Most disturbing are golden dawn\
\
Maybe he would like to view us as victims of this system he so vilifies but the truth is we have much to answer for our predicament because corruption doesn't stop in government it is rife in society, everyone is breaking the law. We tried to implement the ban on smoking 3 TIMES and we still haven't managed to do, because we're such proud motherfuckers we gonna let no one tell us where we can and can't smoke...this is not not just the fault of the government they are a sample of our society. We need more and stronger government not less.\
\
I will not deny corruption in government, it's made of humans after all, despite your spiritual enlightnment plee I don't think is coming anytime soon no matter how well you dress it up in antonyms. The same people who were participating gleefully in the revolution by 'sharing' 'liking' and 'retweeting' have moved on by next week and are planning their next mind expanding trip to thailand/ India / Tibet leaving all the stress of what to do with the world at Heathrow airport, by the time they are back their heads are full beautifully friendly tropical economies...and it was so cheap too!\
\
 but I will argue that corruption in government is a gradient and they very things you attacks are what reduces corruption which by definition means they are serving the people better.\
What if god forbid companies were not quite what he portrays them to be. Let's view them in fact view them as economic species competing in and economic direction. And what if then the drivers of the survival were us. And what if suddenly we needed to change direction\
\
\
History is a sample n=1 and hindsight is 20/20 vision. we are continuously experimenting and we don't necessarily know what the outcome will be READ HISTORY REVIEW. re: fortuitous accidents. everything is an experiment and ideological experiments have been the bloodiest in history.\
\
again it is trivialised but the tasks at hand are overwhelming and you may not want to believe but it is not an easy job, it's just fashionable to bash them.\
\
How much power do they actually have? what are the profits where to they go, how do they move through the world\
Moral crusades of \
\
You are the cynic if you believe there is no one out there \
\
And the apathy actually stems from that but what if I did decide to come down to the street and you were there with your possie and we disagreed...I wonder would I just be lamented as one of those encourages\
And so I agree on alot but fundamentally I disagree on alot \
Ultimately they are very fashionable, some might say they height of fashion delighting the publish with flashy combinations of rhetoric and evocative prose\
\
So I am evil? Am I the victim? I still don't understand. All I know from the familiar caricaturisation is than the people living on the rubbish mountain are not evil. `But so what about me? Where do I find my spiritual awaking? any good self help books you could recommend cause I do hve other shit to tend to too? Or should I even be working? Is that encouraging them too. I mean that's what pays their wages right? Taxes on my work so maybe yeah, should I just stop altogether. Then I could experience the famine and then I would definitely be a good guy. But wait, not necessary, all I need to do is hit the streets and demand a fairer world...oh hang on what?? The world has been getting fairer. I'm not saying we stop here but we better be honest about what has brought about this fairness and stop hiding behind unsubstansiated Marxist rhetoric. \
\
What I enjoyed about the piece what's it's honesty...indeed the most refreshing aspect about it was it's honesty...it's important and seems a luxury in todays pr led political digression. I dream of people to be able to be honest. Yes the people at the top are dishonest, greedy, weak but they are not allowed to say it, mainly because we expect superhuman qualities that we have not ourselves necessarily perfected. We are all hiding our weakness, struggling with our inner world and to relate it to a fast paced ever growing stream of information about the outside world. Are we apathetic only because we are ignored? No i don't hink so but because it is a lot to ask to grasp the entire economic system with all it's unknown nuisances\
\
You are articulate, highly literate and \
\
You are obviously, intelligent, articulate highly read I cannot deny your comments have weight and importance in social commentary. it is the devil in the detail\
So were they,\
I am not in any shape or form\
But this is a war, war you declare! you know it it always has been, the question is, will it always be such? Can you look me in the idea and tell be you are 100% condifent that we got it in us? This you utopia? Are we just a series of bloody collision of social, polticial and economic memes? Will The revolution may not be televised, but this one may well be tweeted this  Every time "fighting" inevitable? And in fact OI would be interested  to know what you think on the role of violence in revolution\

\b0 \
"One of the principle reasons for the legislation in Germany is the necessity to combat Bolshevism. This legislation is not anti-Jewish, but pro-German. The rights of Germans are thereby to be protected against destructive Jewish influences.\

\b \'85
\b0  the Jews who formed less than one per cent. of the population tried to monopolize the cultural leadership of the people and flooded the intellectual professions, such as, for example, jurisprudence and medicine. The influence of this intellectual Jewish class in Germany had everywhere a disintegrating effect . For this reason in order to bar the spread of this process of disintegration it became essential to take steps to establish a clear and clean separation between the two races.\

I am not that cynic, I see social change all around me as well as everything you point out too\

We need desperately to tweak and it is unknown if we will manage, but to throw it away\
\
Think about the logistics of adapting to climate change for example, how in your view is this achieved\
Stuff is evolving, the economic changes are view as disasters of greed but provide the ground for evolution and diversification and the emergence of new paradims but the market is absolutely essential!!!\
