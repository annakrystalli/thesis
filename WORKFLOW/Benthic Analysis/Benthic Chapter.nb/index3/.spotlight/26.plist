	<string>Methods Functional Trait data Data from Tyler &amp; Webb compiled Continuous data where standardised to have a mean of zero  and SD of 1. Data selection  Taxonomic data Data on the taxonomic classification of species  were sourced from WoRMS, some missing data was supplemented from the biotic database All analyses were performed in R using package vegan  A total of 13 variables across 204 species were investigated (see table 1), Species table?? Data Analysis The method selected to calculate functional diversity was the dendrogram method of Petchey &amp; Gaston (Petchey:2002ug}, {Petchey:2006ck} for a number of reasons The functional diversity index recognises a hierarchical partitioning of functional space. As such it shares both conceptual and computational parallels with taxonomic classification and taxonomic measures of diversity {Petchey:2006ck} Mainly however because of the similarity it shares with the calculation of taxonomic distinctness in it's use of a clustrering algorithm to produce a functional dendrogram, analogous to a taxonomic dendrogram Briefly, a distance matrix of species dissimilarities is computed across all selected functional traits. Categorical variables were coded as a series of binomial variables, one category for each modality. As a result of the mixed nature of trait data (mixture of binomial and continuous variables) the gower distance between each species was calculated ({Petchey:2007dw}{Podani:2006fo}) and binomial variables were treated as asymmetric, ie more importance was placed on species sharing the presence of a trait than sharing the absence of a trait. A clustering algorithm (UPGMA) was then used to produce a dendrogram The species identity of members of each cluster were determined at each clustering event and the ABL of each cluster was calculated from taxonomic data Normal behaviour of cluster TD for a complete set of species going up a taxonomic dendrogram is that TD generally increases as taxonomic aggregation increases. However, as a result of the standardisation of our selected measure of taxonomic distinctness (average taxonomic branch length connecting selected species) taxonomic distinctness of similarly related species will decrease as more species are added despite the consistency in the relatedness of the species making the measure sensitive to number of species included in the analysis and cluster size.  As such the average trend of cluster ABL was also calculated going up taxonomic trees as the inclusion and exclusion of species is likely to affect it allowing comparison of the FD trend to the underlying taxonomic trend.  RESULTS Relationship between branch height (cluster dissimilarity) and cluster Δ+ is funnel shaped with a linear generally explaining very low levels of variance (generally much lower than &lt;15%) despite occasional significance. The funnel shape demonstrates high levels of variance at lower branch lengths, reminiscent of the relationship between Δ+ and number of species ({Clarke:1998um})  indicating that the trend may well be driven by mainly by the size of the clusters which generally increases moving towards the root of the dendrogram {Clarke:2001tp}  </string>
