	<string>Skeleton Taxonomic distinctness Definition {ELLINGSEN:2005bu} Humphries &amp; Williams (1991) proposed to use an index of taxonomic distinctiveness of species based on cladistic classification (see also May 1990) Later,Warwick &amp; Clarke (1995) introduced two new measures of bio- diversity, taxonomic diversity (∆) and taxonomic distinctness (∆*) based on quantitative data, and subsequently Clarke &amp; Warwick (1998) defined average taxonomic distinctness (∆+) for presence/absence data. Clarke &amp; Warwick (2001) also proposed a further index, variation in taxonomic distinctness (Λ+). All these measures differ from more conventional diversity indices by incorporating the degree to which the species are taxonomically related to each other. Average taxonomic distinctness is defined as: ∆+ = [Σ Σi&lt;j ωij]/[s(s − 1)/2], where s is the number of species present, the double summation is over {i = 1, ... s;	j = 1, ... s, such that i &lt; j}, and ωij	is the ‘distinctness weight’ given to the path length linking species i and j in the hierarchical classification (Clarke &amp; Warwick 1998). The taxonomic levels used in this study are species, genus, family, order, class and phylum, according to the classification described by Howson (1987). Values of ∆+ are based on equal step lengths between these six taxonomic levels. Thus the weighting between taxonomic levels for different species in the same genus is ω = 16·67, for species in different genera, but the same family ω = 33·33, for species in different families, but the same order ω = 50, etc., and ω = 100 for species connected at the highest (taxonomically coarsest) level. Behaviour {ELLINGSEN:2005bu} Species richness and average taxonomic distinctness are not conceptually (or mechanistically) related, and there is no reason to suppose that a pair of species, drawn randomly from an undisturbed assemblage with naturally low species richness, is less taxonomically distinct than a pair of species drawn randomly from a naturally rich community.  Using a data set on free-living marine nematodes from the coasts of Britain and Chile, Warwick &amp; Clarke (1998) examined the influence of habitat type and diversity on average taxonomic dis- tinctness (∆+). They concluded that species richness measures of biodiversity are much more strongly affected by habitat type and complexity than ∆+. However, they argued that further studies are necessary before any generalization could be attached to their findings. We found no clear relationship between the two uni- variate biodiversity measures, ∆+ and S, and therefore assemblages with lower species richness do not neces- sarily have a smaller average taxonomic range than those with many species. Usage {ELLINGSEN:2005bu} In marine soft-bottom studies multivariate methods have proven much more sensitive to small changes in faunal composition than species richness and diversity indices (e.g. Gray et al. 1990; Warwick &amp; Clarke 1991). Benthic communities that have been perturbed are generally kept in an early successional stage with relatively few species, many of which are closely related. In contrast, less perturbed benthic communities in a late successional stage tend to comprise a range of different species belonging to many phyla (Warwick &amp; Clarke 1995).  The majority of marine studies in which indices of taxonomic distinctness have been applied have focused on patterns of biodiversity in relation to anthropogenic perturbations (e.g. Warwick &amp; Clarke 1995, 1998; Hall &amp; Greenstreet 1998; Brown, Clarke &amp; Warwick 2002). Previously, Ellingsen &amp; Gray (2002) studied patterns of biodiversity on the Norwegian continental shelf, focusing on alpha, beta and gamma diversity as well as rarity. Here we extend these analyses using information on how closely the organisms are related to each other. In the present paper we concentrate on ∆+ based on presence/absence of species rather than quantitative data, so that comparisons can be made with data where sampling is less carefully controlled. The objectives of this paper were to: (1) examine whether average taxo- nomic distinctness is related to latitude, depth and/or sediment type; (2) determine whether one phylum can act as a surrogate for the total fauna or any other phyla; and (3) examine the relationship between average taxonomic distinctness and species richness. &lt;- Using only taxonomy were able to use info on 800 species {May:1990uk} In terms of use in conservation: "we need to combine at the very least quantitative measures of taxonomic distinctness with more familiar ecological considerations of abundance and distribution. Some may mind it surprising that taxonomy, embodied in the hierarchical trees of systematists, stand alongside ecology in the emerging calculus. There should be no surprise. Without taxonomy to give shape to the bricks and systematics to tell us how to put them together, the house of biological science is a meaningless jumble"  Advocated the use of taxonomic distinctness of species in conservation. Relation to ecosystem function Pitfalls {ELLINGSEN:2005bu} However, measures of taxonomic distinctness across all phyla must be considered with more care, as taxonomic ranks (e.g. families, orders) may differ between different phyla. The Linnaean hierarchical taxonomy and classification is constantly being modified based on cladistics and phylogeny. An updated classification of the crustaceans (Martin &amp; Davis 2001) based on phylogenetic informa- tion and traditional Linnaean ranks resulted in an increase of 197 families compared with a previous clas- sification (Bowman &amp; Abele 1982). Such revisions may well occur in other phyla in the future.  Clarke &amp; Warwick (1999) pointed out that ∆+ are not constrained only to hierarchies with fixed points of genus, family, order, etc., but carry over naturally and forcefully to a continuous phylogeny in which the branch lengths are fully determined, for example by genetic distances (e.g. Nei 1996). Linnaean classifications are a simple, discrete approximation to a fully fledged phylogeny, but still better than no classification Further- more, Clarke &amp; Warwick (1999) and Rogers et al. (1999) showed strong insensitivity of ∆+ to major variations in the assumed branch step lengths between taxa ranks. Branch step lengths are currently determined by the fixed points of Linnaean classifications and, naturally, the further these are away from a true phylogenetic ranking, the less meaningful the final interpretation is likely to be (but see Rogers et al. 1999). Whether it is appropriate to calculate taxonomic distinctness across different phyla, or instead restrict calculations of this measure to within different phyla (as advocated by, e.g. Clarke &amp; Warwick 1999), is arguable. There is a trade-off between the taxonomic breadth of an assemblage under consideration and the likelihood that taxonomic ranks within the assemblage are consistent. Within a typical marine assemblage con- taining a mixture of phyla, one must take into account the fact that differences between samples may result from differences in the application of taxonomic ranks within phyla. If the analysis is restricted to a single phylum the problem in no way disappears because no, for example, polychaete or crustacean groups is likely to have received the same amount of attention, and at the same time the hierarchy is truncated by one rank. The closer one approaches groups in which there is a greater probability of consistency in use of taxonomic nomenclature, the less useful information on relatedness between species is likely to remain. The investigator must therefore carefully decide which aspect of this trade-off is more pertinent to the hypothesis being tested. Background {ELLINGSEN:2005bu} Because of the impracticality of routinely attempting comprehensive surveys of all living species from the whole spectrum of habitat types, ‘surrogacy’ methods will clearly become the norm in biodiversity estimation Most studies of biodiversity in both marine and terrestrial systems deal with species richness patterns. However, the biological diversity of an area is more than the numbers of species present assemblages with the same number of species may comprise species that are closely related to each other taxonomically, or they may be more distantly related. Functional Diversity Definition {Petchey:2002ug} This study demonstrates the utility of FD as a measure of functional diversity. It measures the extent of trait complementarity among species; it measures diversity across all scales simultaneously; and it is a continuous measure of the natural variation among species. FD is an amalgam of the diversity caused by species richness, number of functional groups, community composition, and species identity.  Behaviour Usage Relation to ecosystem function / community ecology {McGill:2006fb} Suggested that focusing on traits is one of the key research area to enhance generality in community ecology results, arguing that a 'nomenclatural' (taxonomic approach) focusing on species identities has resulted in a loss of ecological generality which is maintain through traits approaches.
