	<string>Implementation taxa2dist Varstep = T ends up with less that 100 for completely taxonomically distinct and zeros for species of same family. Not appropriate USE Varstep = F Use check = F but then need to include species as well otherwise distance for same genus will be 0 Calculating Delta+ In distance matrix use all species included in particular run of analysis To calculate node Delta+ Î”f+ create matrix for all species and code species in node with 1 This will allow calculation of SD for node size </string>
