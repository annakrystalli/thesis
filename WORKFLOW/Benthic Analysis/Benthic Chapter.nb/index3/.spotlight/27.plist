	<string>Discussion {Petchey:2006ck} For functional classifications, there should be no target number of traits, rather the correct number of traits is the number that are functionally important. The number of traits (as well as correlations between them and their relative weighting) can under certain circumstances alter the level of functional redundancy that an assemblage appears to exhibit (Petchey &amp; Gaston 2002a; Rosenfeld 2002). A greater number of traits tends to make for a less redundant assemblage (i.e. functional diversity is sensitive to changes in species richness) and a smaller number a redundant assemblage (i.e. changes in species richness have little effect on functional diversity), making redundancy appear a rather subjective property.   High quality information is, for example, direct information about resource use patterns (i.e. a hard trait, Hodgson et al. 1999). These are relatively straightforward to document in larger animals through direct observation of feeding behaviour (Holmes et al. 1979) or examination of gut contents (Mun Ìƒoz &amp; Ojeda 1997). They may require greater effort to document for plants (e.g. relative growth rate, Knevel et al. 2003), however,  plant ecologists often measure traits that are correlated with hard traits. These so-called soft traits (e.g. tissue density, leaf size and specific leaf area) provide indirect information on functionally important traits. The use of soft traits greatly decreases the amount of effort required to compile functional information, so that data about thousands of plant species can be obtained (e.g. Knevel et al. 2003). In benthic organisms many hard traits may be (derived / inferred / replaced from soft morphological traits which may also dictate taxonomic classification in which case taxonomy may well approach functional diversity Only presence absence data -&gt; eveness not incorporated {Purvis:2000uo} </string>
